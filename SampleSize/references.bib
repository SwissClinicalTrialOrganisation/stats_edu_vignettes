    abstract = "{The underlying risk of death in the absence of treatment after a myocardial infarction (MI) is poorly documented.Analysis of 23 published studies in which 14 211 patients were followed prospectively after MI; 6817 deaths were recorded. We restricted the analysis to studies in which follow-up was completed by 1980 to quantify the underlying risk in the absence of effective treatments.After a first MI, on average, 23\\% of patients died before reaching the hospital and another 13\\% died during hospital admission; these rates increased with age. After hospital discharge cardiovascular mortality was approximately 10\\% in the first year and 5\\% per year thereafter, rates that were unrelated to age or sex. The yearly death rate of 5\\% persisted indefinitely; after 15 years, cumulative cardiovascular mortality was 70\\%. After a subsequent MI, 33\\% of patients died before reaching the hospital, and 20\\% died in hospital. After discharge, cardiovascular mortality was approximately 20\\% in the first year and 10\\% per year thereafter, rates again unrelated to age and sex. Approximately a third of all heart disease deaths occurred minutes after the first MI, a sixth during the first hospitalization, and half after a subsequent MI, which could occur many years after the first.In persons with a history of MI, cardiovascular mortality in the absence of treatment is high—5\\% per year after a first MI and 10\\% per year after a subsequent MI, persisting for many years and probably for the rest of a person's life. The high mortality rate emphasizes the need to ensure that everyone who has had an MI, even years previously, receives effective preventive treatment.Arch Intern Med. 2002;162:2405-2410-->}",
